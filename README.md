# Isidore Farm

#### Public website for Isidore Farm LLC in Lenoir, NC.

Established in 2015 in the great state of North Carolina with the goal of building a small, productive, self supporting family farm and to share this info and how-to with others interested in building their own farm business. Info on the various projects over the years is found in the articles section, the gallery has photo collections of these projects. We're still small scale, but growing quickly. We're currently an out-grower for another local farm which runs a CSA, providing the people of the foothills the world's most delicious pasture raised eggs and heirloom tomatoes.*

*claims of deliciousness, while totally true, are based solely on Isidore Farm owner opinion.
