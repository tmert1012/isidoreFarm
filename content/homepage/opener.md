Established in 2015 in the great state of North Carolina with the goal of building a small, productive, self supporting family farm and to share this info and how-to with others interested in building their own farm business. Check out our gallery, it has photo collections of various projects and farm pictures. We're still small scale, but growing quickly. We're currently providing the people of the foothills the world's most delicious pasture raised eggs and produce!
