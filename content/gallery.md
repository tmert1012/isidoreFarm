The first AP project in Oklahoma. Built elevated shallow beds filled with hydroton. Ebb and flow, single pump on a timer. Grew weeds to start and koi fish because of the cold winters. Tried various vegetables with some success.

Reworked Grubbertron, tried to simplify and move to a single pump, no timers and bell siphon. Moved to a larger tank for the fish, started incorporating duckweed into the system.
