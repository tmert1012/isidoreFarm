			    <h1>Isidore Farm</h1>
Established in 2015 in the great state of North Carolina with the goal of building a small, productive, self supporting family farm and to share this info and how-to with others interested in building their own farm business. Info on the various projects over the years is found in the <a href="/articles">articles</a> section, the <a href="/gallery">gallery</a> has photo collections of these projects. We're still small scale, but growing quickly. We're currently an out-grower for another local farm which runs a CSA, providing the people of the foothills the world's most delicious pasture raised eggs and heirloom tomatoes.*
<br /><br >
<i>*claims of deliciousness, while totally true, are based solely on Isidore Farm owner opinion.</i>
